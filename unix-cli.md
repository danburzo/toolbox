# Unix command-line tools

The standard command-line tools available on Unix-based systems are wonderful, if occasionally inscrutable. This page contains some commands I found useful.

_Note:_ I'm writing these commands on macOS and while they're almost always identical across all Unix-based systems there _are_ some (small) differences in the tools that come with the operating system. Some options from Linux may not be available on macOS, or viceversa.

## Tools used

* [`find`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_(Unix))
* [`sort`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(Unix))
* [`uniq`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq)
* [`wc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wc_(Unix))
* [`xargs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs)

You can read about the available options for any tool by running `man`:

```bash
man <command>
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The `man` help pages can sometimes be hard to understand. [`tldr`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) is a community-driven effort to offer clearer examples of each command, so you might want to look into it.

## Tricks to aid refactoring

I found these commands useful for poking around a large codebase.

### Sort files by number of lines

This command sorts all JavaScript files in the current folder by their line count, from the largest file to the smallest.

```bash
find . -name '*.js' | xargs wc -l | sort -r
```

Example output:

```
   92573 total
    3203 js/first-file.js
    2443 js/second-file.js
    1858 js/third-file.js
    ...
```

How it's built:

1. `find` all JavaScript files (`*.js`) in the current (`.`) folder
2. pass the results, via `xargs`, to the line counter (`wc`)
3. `sort` the line count report from largest to smallest (`-r`)

#### Dealing with spaces in file names

For the command to work with spaces in file names, we need to make `find` and `xargs` work better together by using these options:

* `-print0` makes `find` print all the file names in one line, separated by _null characters_, instead of the default new-line character.
* `-0` makes `xargs` assume that the inputs are separated by the _null character_ instead of a white-space character (i.e. the new-line character used by default in `find`)

The command now looks like this:

```bash
find . -name '*.js' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l | sort -r
```


### Find all unique occurrences of a certain pattern

This command looks at code that matches the pattern "console._something_()" and extracts all the different `something`s.

```bash
find . -name '*.js' | xargs perl -nle 'print $1 if /console\.([a-z]+)\(/i' | sort -u
```

Example output:

```
error
info
log
time
timeEnd
trace
warn
```

How it's built:

1. `find` all JavaScript files (`*.js`) in the current directory (`.`)
2. pass the file names to a `perl` command that extracts a RegExp pattern
3. finally, `sort` the extracted patterns to show only `-u`nique occurrences

> ðŸ’¡ To make the command work with files that contain spaces in their name, we'll need to use [the `-print0` / `-0` combo](#dealing-with-spaces-in-file-names) again.

#### The `perl` part

> Unix-based systems have another tool for matching patterns, called `grep`. However, `grep` on macOS doesn't have an option [to extract just _a part of a RegExp_](https://superuser.com/questions/1355777/grep-on-macos-find-unique-occurrences-of-a-capturing-group-in-regular-expressio), so we need to use `perl` for this.

Glossing over the `-nle` arguments to the `perl` command ([about which you can read here](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlrun.html)), the code looks for the pattern:

```js
/console\.([a-z]+)\(/i
```

And prints the first _capturing group_ (`[a-z]+`) out of the regular expression.

#### Variation: find most frequent occurrences of a certain pattern

Here, instead of finding the list of unique occurrences of a certain pattern, we count how many time a certain pattern occurs.

```bash
find . -name '*.js' | xargs perl -nle 'print $1 if /console\.([a-z]+)\(/i' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

The command will result in something like:

```
  85 log
  65 error
  52 warn
  19 time
  17 timeEnd
   9 info
   6 trace
```

The `find` and `perl` parts are the same, but we've replaced `sort -u` with:

1. A simple `sort` to sort the occurrences alphabetically, then
2. `-c`ount the occurrences of `uniq`ue patterns, then
3. `sort` the patterns again by the number of occurrences (`-n`umeric and `-r`reversed)
