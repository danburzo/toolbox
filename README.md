## Miscellaneous tips & tricks

#### Start a server for a folder

OS X and Linux come with Python preinstalled. In your project folder, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. This makes it available at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

#### Fetch a file from the web

If you want to get a data file from the web in the command line, `wget` is the simplest:

```shell
wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/romania-latest.osm.pbf
```

(On OS X, you can install `wget` with Homebrew: `brew install wget`)

To fetch a file using Node, a minimal example:

```js
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

var url = 'http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/romania-latest.osm.pbf';
var output = 'romania-latest.osm.pbf';

http.get(url, function(res) {
	res.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(output));
});
```

#### Make a S3 bucket publicly available

To use a S3 bucket to keep a bunch of files and make them publicly available, you need to make a __bucket policy__. This is under _Permissions_ section on the _Properties_ tab for your bucket. Paste this into the bucket policy (`myBucketName` should be the name of your bucket):

```js
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::myBucketName/*"
		}
	]
}
```

All the files inside will typically be available at `http://myBucketName.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/file` but you can grab the exact URL from the _Static Website Hosting_ section in the _Properties_ tab.

This is super-useful for hosting video files, since S3 supports __partial content requests__ which is needed to loop `<video>` on your web pages.

### Quick project scaffolding

In the command line, you can use the `mkdir` and `touch` utilities to quickly create a bunch of folders and files for your project:

```
cd my-project
mkdir js css img test
touch .gitignore index.html README.md CHANGELOG.md css/style.css js/app.js
```

This will create the structure:

```
- my-project
  - css
    - style.css
  - js
    - app.js
  - img
  - test
  .gitignore
  index.html
  README.md
  CHANGELOG.md
```
