# Toolbox

This is a collection of tricks, tools, libraries, APIs and data sources for creative projects. It's a reference as well as a compendium of things you can do in the browser and the command line.

It's inspired by [javierarce/toolbox](https://github.com/javierarce/toolbox). Contributions are welcome via [issues](https://github.com/danburzo/toolbox/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/danburzo/toolbox/pulls).

## JavaScript libraries

### Image processing, optical character recognition (OCR)

#### [quaggaJS](https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS)

> __QuaggaJS is a barcode-scanner entirely written in JavaScript__ supporting real-time localization and decoding of various types of barcodes such as EAN, CODE 128, CODE 39, EAN 8, UPC-A, UPC-C, I2of5 and CODABAR. The library is also capable of using `getUserMedia` to get direct access to the user's camera stream. Although the code relies on heavy image- processing even recent smartphones are capable of locating and decoding barcodes in real-time.

## Miscellaneous tips & tricks

### Start a server for a folder

Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in your project folder to make it available at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

__Note:__ The syntax above is for the Python 2.x that comes preinstalled with macOS and Linux. The equivalent syntax for Python 3 is `python -m http.server`. 

### Fetch a file from the web

To fetch a file from the web with the command line, using `wget` is straightforward:

```shell
wget http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/romania-latest.osm.pbf
```

(On macOS, you can install `wget` with Homebrew: `brew install wget`)

Or, fetching a file in Node.js:

```js
require('http').get('http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/romania-latest.osm.pbf', function(response) {
    response.pipe(require('fs').createWriteStream('romania-latest.osm.pbf'));
});
```

### Make a S3 bucket publicly available

To use a S3 bucket to keep a bunch of files and make them publicly available, you need to make a __bucket policy__. This is under _Permissions_ section on the _Properties_ tab for your bucket. Paste this into the bucket policy (`myBucketName` should be the name of your bucket):

```js
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::myBucketName/*"
		}
	]
}
```

All the files inside will typically be available at `http://myBucketName.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/file` but you can grab the exact URL from the _Static Website Hosting_ section in the _Properties_ tab.

__Extra credit:__ This is super-useful for hosting video files, since S3 supports __partial content requests__ which is needed to loop `<video>` on your web pages.

### Wget for website mirroring / scraping

Here are some useful tricks with `wget`. [More of them here](http://www.labnol.org/software/wget-command-examples/28750/).

#### Mirror a website

```
wget --mirror --no-clobber --no-parent --wait=3 --execute robots=off --domains=danburzo.ro,assets.danburzo.ro ‐‐user-agent=Mozilla danburzo.ro
```

A quick explanation for these flags: 

* `--mirror` is a shorthand for `-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing`, which are some switches useful for scraping
* `--no-clobber` instructs wget not to fetch each occurrence of the same URL as a separate file
* `--no-parent` don't go up the hierarchy
* `--wait=seconds` is used to wait for N seconds between requests, a.k.a. being nice to the server
* `--execute robots=off` will ignore the `robots.txt` file on the website and any `nofollow` attributes on links
* `--domains=domain1,domain2,...` is a list of domain names to consider when crawling (you'll want to include here any domains that hold the assets for the page)
* `--user-agent=UserAgentString` can be used in case the server blocks access based on the User Agent

#### Download sequential URLs

```
wget http://example.com/records/{1..1000}
```

#### Download a list of URLs

The URLs can be specified in a separate file `list-of-URLs.txt`, with one URL per line.

```
wget ‐‐input list-of-URLs.txt
```
