### Pasting copied objects as SVG

Illustrator has this neat feature that lets you copy (<kbd>⌘C</kbd>) any object from your design and paste them (<kbd>⌘V</kbd>) as SVG in any text editor. However, configuring _how_ the SVG is generated is a bit obscure:

1. With any Illustrator file, go to <kbd>File → Save As...</kbd> or <kbd>File → Save a Copy...</kbd> and choose <kbd>Format: SVG</kbd>
2. On the next screen, called <kbd>SVG Options</kbd>, you can configure how the SVG will be generated. (Click on <kbd>More Options</kbd> to see all of them). Then, press <kbd>OK</kbd>
3. The options you set on that screen will apply to SVGs you copy to the clipboard from now on

You only need to do this once, and whenever you want to change the way the SVG gets generated.
