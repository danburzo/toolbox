### Working with SVG

#### Pasting copied objects as SVG

Illustrator has this neat feature that lets you copy (<kbd>âŒ˜C</kbd>) any object from your design and paste it (<kbd>âŒ˜V</kbd>) as SVG in any text editor. However, configuring _how_ the SVG is generated is a bit obscure:

1. With any Illustrator file, go to <kbd>File â†’ Save As...</kbd> or <kbd>File â†’ Save a Copy...</kbd> and choose <kbd>Format: SVG</kbd>
2. On the next screen, called <kbd>SVG Options</kbd>, you can configure how the SVG will be generated. (Click on <kbd>More Options</kbd> to see all of them). Then, press <kbd>OK</kbd>
3. The options you set on this screen will apply to SVGs you copy to the clipboard from now on

> ðŸ’¡ You only need to do this once, or whenever you want to change the way the SVG gets generated.

#### Create a rectangle to serve as a viewbox

To create a `viewbox` for the SVG while using the copy/paste trick, you can draw a rectangle behind your artwork to serve this purpose. After pasting the artwork in a text editor, you can just delete the background `<rect>` element.

#### Expand the appearance

TBD.


### Working with Area Type

__Area Type__ is the text area in Illustrator. You can scale the bounding box and the text inside will reflow â€” as opposed to _point type_, which scales like any other shape. 

#### Switch between Type and Area Type

Double-click on the prong that sticks out of the _right side_ of the box.

#### Auto-fit area to the text content

Double-click on the prong that sticks out of the _bottom side_ of the box to fit the area snugly around the text.

> ðŸ’¡ Set this behavior as the default by going to <kbd>Illustrator â†’ Preferencesâ€¦ â†’ Type </kbd> and check <kbd>Auto Size New Area Type</kbd>.

#### Resize area type without stretching the text

Selecting a type area and entering a width / height in the Transform pane will stretch the text instead of resizing the text area and reflowing the text. To achieve the latter, use the Direct Selection tool (<kbd>A</kbd>) to select _just the area_ and not the text inside. In this state, using the width / height inputs from the Transform pane will scale the text area without distoring the text. 

> ðŸ’¡ You can also set the area's size (along with other options) from the <kbd>Type â†’ Area Type Optionsâ€¦</kbd> menu item.
